# About

This was my final project for CPSC 591 - Rendering. 

Many games with large open worlds have dynamic weather and lighting systems to give players a greater sense of immersion. A big part of creating convincing and beautiful worlds is creating convincing and beautiful clouds. In this project, I developed a shader which procedurally generates volumetric clouds using noise functions and ray marching techniques.
